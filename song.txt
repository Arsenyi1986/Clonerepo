At the time before the dawn
We will leave this sleeping city
We will take the secret trope
To those lakes in the hills
Where sundown is cherry-colored
Where the beauty makes me dizzy
Noone will became a spare here

You will learn that it is easy
Not to think about a parting
Not to flinch in full alarm
Not to rid yourself with boredom 
Not remember any debts
Not to play and get unmsked 
We will find love and care here

Oh the Pink Flamingo – the child of sundown
Oh the Pink Flamingo here he danced one day
Maybe in the life that's gone – I cant remember
Think of something better, i'll help it come true
